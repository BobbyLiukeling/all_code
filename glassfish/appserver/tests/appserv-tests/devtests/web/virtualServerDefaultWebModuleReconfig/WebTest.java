 * Unit test for 6526113 ("virtual server throws bad request for static
 * docs when default webmodule is set"):
 *
 * This test:
 *
 * - creates a new virtual server
 * - deploys a webapp;
 * - set the virtual server's default-web-module with the deployed webapp
 * - creates a new http-listener, and has its default-virtual-server attribute
 *   point to the newly created virtual server;
 * - accesses the new virtual server, and ensures that its default-web-module
 *   is honored
